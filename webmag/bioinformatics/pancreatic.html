								<h3>Diagnosing Pancreatic Cancer Earlier Using Genetic Analysis</h3>
								<p>Cancers are still incurable. But many wake up everyday with the disease and manage to keep living with the hope that their treatments will eventually lead to the cure. Imagine having a disease that is not only incurable but also one where there are no treatments that have shown high efficacy and you are only diagnosed with the disease when it is too late.</p>
								<p>Welcome to the life of a cancer patient</p>
								<p>A few weeks ago, I was scrolling across the internet and came across some depressing news. I found that Alex Trebek, the host of the game show Jeopardy since 1994 has been diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. He shares his diagnosis with 50,000 other people each year who are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the US alone. The sad thing is, most of those people will die. Pancreatic cancer remains the cancer with the lowest survival rate.</p>
								<figure class="figure-img">
									<img class="img-responsive" src="/webmag/img/Pancreatic/Pancreatic_rate.jpeg" alt="">
								</figure>
								<p>With such a low survival rate we would think it would be given the attention it deserves but it has not. It has been underfunded for decades, only receiving 2% of all cancer funding. Unlike most cancers, the survival rate has not budged in over 40 years. We cannot even imagine how long ago 40 years was in terms of cancer research. 40 years ago we were only beginning to discover the genes that underlie cancer. But now, we know so much about the genome and the progression of cancer, we have improved treatments for chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. We are talking about possible new therapies that might cure some cancers like CAR T-cell therapy and gene editing. Throughout all this change, it is almost impossible for the survival rate not to even budge for pancreatic cancer. But it is the sad truth.</p>
								<p>The primary treatment for pancreatic cancer still remains surgery but only 10-20% are candidates for surgery and less than 20% of that group are alive after 5 years of surgery. Early diagnosis for pancreatic cancer is the biggest problem of why so many are dying. Early diagnosis for most cancer is defined as stage 1 or stage 2. But early diagnosis is defined as stage 3 for patients with pancreatic cancer!</p>
								<p>So, how are we going to do it? How are we going to get more people living longer and increase that 5% survival rate? The answer comes with the new age of personalized medicine.</p>
								<p>Personalized medicine is this idea of treating the patient rather than the population. It is about creating a diagnosis and treatment that is specifically tailored to the patient. A big increase in the idea of personalized medicine came with gene sequencing.

In 2001, we had the Human Genome Project where we sequenced the full human genome. Sequencing basically means reading DNA. Since then, we have increased the accuracy and speed at which we sequence through technologies known as next-generation sequencing technologies. It is poised to enable earlier and more accurate diagnosis of disease risk and occurrence, and play a role in the prevention of future disease.</p>
								<p>We have tried to implement and make this dream come true by decreasing the price of sequencing and it has dropped millions fold. The Human Genome Project costed $3 billion and now we are down to a $600 genome. In the next coming years we might even get that down to a $99 genome. We cannot even begin to comprehend how fast these prices have been dropping a company can pay to sequence people's genomes and then sell that info to research centers and hospitals and make a profit!</p>
								<figure class="figure-img">
									<img class="img-responsive" src="/webmag/img/Pancreatic/cost_per_genome.jpeg" alt="">
								</figure>
								<p>So why aren’t we all getting our genes sequenced? It makes sense that if we can find certain genes and how they are different in patients, it can unlock so much and improve our healthcare system for both earlier diagnosis and personalized therapies.</p>
								<p>The answer is that all gene sequencing does is turn our DNA into a read of A’s, T’s, C’s and G’s. But if you read a large paper of scrambled letters, you will not know if someone has cancer or not. We do not have a sequencing problem anymore, we have an analysis problem. We need to analyze reads of DNA so that we can find biomarkers and diagnose diseases earlier and more precise. The process of doing this has yet been optimized so they can work with the fast and accurate gene sequencing.</p>
								<h4>Solving Our Analysis Problem</h4>
								<p>I was going to find biomarkers by using a tool called Galaxy. Galaxy is a computational biology platform that allows researchers to analyze genetic data and deliver the desired result. This tool is free to use and contains multiple preloaded datasets and tools you can use to manipulate data. My plan was to use galaxy to find genes that are highly expressed in pancreatic cancer patients.</p>
								<p>If you do not know what gene expression is, you can understand it by thinking of our cells as factories. Factories use an instruction manual to produce a certain product. The same thing happens in our cells except the instruction manual is our DNA and the product are the proteins that perform a specific function in our body. The rate of production of these products corresponds to the gene expression in our cells. When a gene is highly expressed, more of the protein is produced and therefore it is inferred that the cell wants more of that protein to perform the function that it does. When genes are highly expressed in pancreatic cancer patients that means that gene has some advantageous characteristics to allow the cancer to grow faster, we can call these biomarkers for pancreatic cancer.

After I defined my project I went on the long hunt for what dataset I could use to find the gene expression. The amount of data we have about our genome is unbelievable. I found my data through galaxies shared data platform and found a transcriptome sequencing of chromosome one in pancreatic cancer cell lines.</p>
								<h4>Transcriptome Sequencing</h4>
								<p>To understand what transcriptome sequencing is, you need to understand the process of protein synthesis. DNA is found in our cells and when the cell signals for a specific protein to be produced, the gene is copied to make a single strand of RNA. RNA is another form of nucleic acid. It is different from DNA in a couple of ways, the main one being that it is single stranded. This RNA is then translated into a chain of amino acids which we call a protein.</p>
								<figure class="figure-img">
									<img class="img-responsive" src="/webmag/img/Pancreatic/DNA_to_Pro.jpeg" alt="">
								</figure>
								<p>What transcriptome sequencing dose is sequence the RNA in the cell. We can understand how this corresponds to gene expression by thinking back to our factory analogy. Transcriptome sequencing of RNA is like measuring the products half way through the assembly line. We can find the rate of production from this because we assume that the products halfway through the assembly line will most likely turn into full products. The same thing is with our cells, we can find gene expression from transcriptome sequencing because we presume that most of the RNA in our cells will be translated into proteins.

So for transcriptome sequencing, the RNA is extracted from the cell, converted into DNA which is then called cDNA or copy DNA and then the DNA is sequenced which means that the output is a read of DNA.</p>
								<h4>FastQ Files</h4>
								<p>In my data set the output was what is called a fastq file. It is commonly used in genetics and biology for representing data. It contains three line repeats. The first is the label which tells me where the dataset is in the genome. The second is the quality score for the sequence. This line gives a character which represents a certain quality score for each base pair. Before I do any of my analysis, I look through the dataset and any read that has a very low quality might be trimmed or thrown from the dataset. The last line is the sequence of DNA.</p>
								<figure class="figure-img">
									<img class="img-responsive" src="/webmag/img/Pancreatic/FastQ.jpeg" alt="">
								</figure>
								<h4>Finding Gene Expression</h4>
								<p>There were many steps into finding the expression of the genes but they can be condensed into 2 main steps.</p>
								<p>The first was to find the accepted regions of the transcriptome that correspond with coding parts of the genome. To do this I used a tool called TopHat. TopHat acts like a filter for my data. Since I only want the coding regions of my dataset, TopHat filters the non-coding and overlapping regions away. It does this through aligning it with a reference sequence. The reference sequencing in my case was the human genome.</p>
								<p>So I aligned my inputted pancreatic cancer cell line reads with the human genome reference sequence and then was able to cut out any of the overlapping regions and analyze if certain regions were coding or non-coding. What this outputs is a single file of accepted coding reads that are ready to have the counted expression.</p>
								<figure class="figure-img">
									<img class="img-responsive" src="/webmag/img/Pancreatic/Reference_genome.png" alt="">
								</figure>
								<p>The next large step was to run it through another tool called featurecounts. It uses the locations of the genes provided in the labels to count the number of reads in the TopHat file and give the expression of the genes.</p>
								<p>The outputted file is the data I was looking for the whole time. It is data telling me the gene expression for all of the genes on chromosome 1 in pancreatic cancer patients. The file contains a table that shows the geneid and the relative gene expression. A geneid is the number corresponding to a specific gene. Although we all have these genes inside of our body, we can see that some genes are much higher expressed in these pancreatic cell lines. After sorting, cutting, and analyzing this file, I found many biomarkers that could potentially solve our pancreatic cancer problem. Let’s just look at a few.</p>
								<h4>Biomarker #1:S100A6/A4</h4>
								<figure class="figure-img">
									<img class="img-responsive" src="/webmag/img/Pancreatic/S100.jpeg" alt="">
									<figcaption>So Lorem Ipsum is bad (not necessarily)</figcaption>
								</figure>
								<p>The first ones that were highly expressed are apart of the S100 family of genes, specifically S100A6 and S100A4. These proteins are involved with binding with cations (positively charged atoms), mainly calcium. They have two identical structures which contain their calcium binding domains. S100 family proteins are key in many vital cellular processes, most notably cell cycle progression. When S100 binds to these cations, it signals the cell to progress further along the cell cycle clock.</p>
								<p>In the pancreatic cell lines, what I have found is that S100A6 and S100A4 are highly expressed. When cancer cells have more S100 proteins, the probability of the protein binding with a cation is increased and therefore makes the cell divide faster. Faster cell division is the main characteristic of cancer. S100 is an attractive biomarker to help diagnose pancreatic cancer earlier since it is shown to be highly expressed in the early stages of cancer.</p>
								<h4>Biomarker #2:MUC1</h4>
								<figure class="figure-img">
									<img class="img-responsive" src="/webmag/img/Pancreatic/MUC1.jpeg" alt="">
								</figure>
								<p>The next protein is MUC1. It was also found to be abnormally expressed in pancreatic cancer cell lines that I analyzed. What this overexpression does is contribute to drug-resistance in pancreatic cancer. It is a transmembrane protein which means that it sits around the membrane of the cell. You can think of it as the traffic director of the cell, letting good nutrients out but making sure that bad pathogens don’t enter our cells. But when it is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer patients, all of these traffic directors start to get confused so they might start letting in the bad pathogens and might keep some of the good nutrients out. When chemotherapeutic drugs try and enter the cell they can’t because the MUC1 has built up a resistance to that drug.</p>
								<p>So not only is MUC1 a strong biomarker than can help diagnose pancreatic cancer earlier, it can also be used to monitor if chemotherapy should be delivered to a patient and can allow doctors to not harm the patient by wrongly giving them chemotherapy and reverting to alternative treatments.</p>
								<p>Scientists are also developing a vaccine that can allow our body to target cells with highly expressed MUC1 proteins in their membrane and then kill those cells. This would work by taking an MUC1 protein sample out and delivering that as a vaccine to the body. The immune system would then create a specialized T cell to kill cells expressing high levels of MUC1 on their membrane and then kill them. This would hopefully enable us to control the immune system to selectively kill cancer cells.</p>
								<h4>Biomarker #3: RhoC</h4>
								<figure class="figure-img">
									<img class="img-responsive" src="/webmag/img/Pancreatic/RhoC.jpeg" alt="">
								</figure>
								<p>The final biomarker is called RhoC. RhoC is a protein that is associated withRas family of genes. If you don’t know what Ras genes are they are the genes that are the primary causes of a lot of cancers. What this protein will do is bind to other proteins and genes and then act as the on and off switch for them. It has major roles for cell shape and cell motility. In cancer, it is highly expressed and it causes the cell shape to degrade and increase the motility which causes metastases. It has been studied to be a useful biomarker and has also been shown to be a therapeutic target to inhibit.</p>
								<p>Through looking at some of the biomarkers, we quickly realize how much we can know through genetic analysis.</p>
								<p>We quickly see how much we can know about the progression and treatment of a person’s cancer through my analysis. What is really going to change that sad 5% survival rate is a more informed, earlier diagnosis of pancreatic cancer with the help of genetics and personalized healthcare. I want to change your mindset to thinking that we are going to do that by making sequencing cheaper, we do not have a sequencing problem but an analysis problem. The biomarkers I have researched about can help save millions of lives so we can prevent people like Alex Trebek, family, friends, or the thousands of others from being taken away from us so soon.</p>
